## Team Optimizer
Project was an introduction to coding in C++ and learning about Lists (vectors)

The code simulates an applicant chooser program, choosing applicants for the arbitrarily-chosen Marble Machine X program. The user inputs data on applicants, and after completion, the code chooses four applicants from the list generated during the entry process, one per team, based on the arbitrarily-chosen value of how much experience the applicant has.

## Object Sorting
Project taught about sorting algorithms.

The code creates a "jar" of coins via random generation. How many coins is up to the user. The code then asks the user what type of sorting algorithm to use. I implemented hand-coded bubble sort and bogosort algorithms. The chosen algorithm will sort the coins by their randomly-generated value in cents. After the sort completes, the code displays the now-sorted list of coins through the terminal.

## Trees
Project taught about binary search trees, as well as in-order walk, insertion, and deletion algorithms.

The code creates a binary search tree of ten electric vehicle models, then c-outs the list in alphabetical order using the in-order tree walk algorithm. The code then asks the user for info on a node to insert, then inserts one of its own. The code then c-outs the updated tree with twelve cars. The code then asks for a node to be deleted, then searches for and deletes the node, preserving potential children.

## Final
Project was an implementation of a priority queue.

The code creates a vector that will serve as the vessel for holding the queue, then asks the user for instructions: Add nodes, remove nodes, pop-off nodes, print the queue, and exit the program.

When adding nodes, the code sorts the list by priority, subsorting first-in-first-out in the case of equal priority. The list is sorted every time a node is added for simplicity. 
There are two options for removing nodes: Resolving or Removing. Resolving removes the first node on user confirmation, removing nodes searches for a user-specified node and deletes it if it finds one with the same item name.
